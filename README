This is a repo where I'm working through the book
"The Elements of Computing Systems." The project
materials and tools are from https://www.nand2tetris.org/.

The book and materials are impressive. For people looking
for a more guided path, they also teach via Coursera:

https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer
https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2

My solutions here are not intended to be optimal, but
I wanted to keep track of them for reference.
